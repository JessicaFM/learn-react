# LEARN REACT

This project provides some basic examples based on React working with Vite.

In this example, I'm going to work in a basic card example. The card info will be provided in a .json file, and I'm goint to create two basic React components: 
- Cards
- Card

For this example I will use **Typescript** and [**MaterialUI**](https://mui.com/).
